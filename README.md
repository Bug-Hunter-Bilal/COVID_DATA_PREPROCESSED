# COVID-19 Country Prediction using Machine Learning
 ## Project Overview

This project focuses on preprocessing a COVID-19 dataset and applying multiple machine learning classification algorithms to predict countries based on the given data.
The aim of this project is to demonstrate an end-to-end machine learning workflow, including data cleaning, preprocessing, model training, and performance comparison.

 ## Objectives

- Clean and preprocess a real-world COVID-19 dataset

- Prepare the data for machine learning models

- Train and evaluate multiple classification algorithms

- Compare model performance to understand strengths and limitations

- Gain practical experience in applied AI and Machine Learning

 ## Data Preprocessing

The dataset was preprocessed to improve data quality and model performance. The preprocessing steps included:

- Handling missing and inconsistent values

- Cleaning and formatting raw data

- Feature selection and transformation

- Preparing the dataset for training and testing

- Proper preprocessing played a crucial role in achieving reliable and meaningful results.

 ## Machine Learning Algorithms Used

The following classification algorithms were implemented and tested:

1. Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)

2. Logistic Regression

3. Random Forest Classifier

4. Decision Tree Classifier

5. Linear Support Vector Classifier (Linear SVC)

Each model was trained on the same preprocessed dataset to ensure fair comparison.

 ## Model Evaluation

Models were evaluated using accuracy and classification performance

A comparative analysis was performed to understand how different algorithms behave on the same dataset

This approach helped identify which model performs better for country prediction.
